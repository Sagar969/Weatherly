## My process
This is my first React project. I started with basic react concepts like basic hooks and a lot of prop drilling and with time, I added some advanced features to it and context api to reduce prop drilling.

I used total of three APIs in this project for different purposes. Used react-animations and styled components for animations on mounting and unmounting of components.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with Superpowers
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For animation styling
- [React-animations](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-animations) - Animations for react components
- [React Leaflet API](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - For map
- [Openmeteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) - For Weather data
- [LocationIQ API](https://locationiq.com/) - For GeoCoding


### What I learned

I learned all the react concepts required to build a full fledged app. I learned react hooks, state management, animation in components, context api, Sass styling, API integration and many more things.

### Continued development

I am deep diving into state management in react and learning a state management library called redux after completion of this project.
